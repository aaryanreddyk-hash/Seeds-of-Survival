      <h2>About the Project</h2>

      <h3>Who?</h3>
      <p>The endangerment of crop species affects farmers, consumers, indigenous communities, and the global food system as a whole. Farmers lose access to resilient varieties, consumers face reduced food choices, and traditional communities risk losing culturally important crops. Ultimately, everyone who depends on agriculture—now and in the future—is impacted by the shrinking diversity of crops.</p>

      <h3>What?</h3>
      <p>Many crop species and their wild relatives are becoming endangered due to the rapid loss of genetic diversity. Modern agriculture focuses heavily on a narrow set of high-yield varieties, causing traditional and locally adapted crops to disappear. As these varieties vanish, global agriculture becomes less resilient, and valuable traits such as disease resistance and drought tolerance are lost.</p>

      <h3>When?</h3>
      <p>This issue began to take shape in the mid-20th century with the rise of industrial farming and the Green Revolution, which encouraged the widespread use of uniform crop varieties. The problem intensified in recent decades as climate change, global seed markets, and large-scale monoculture farming accelerated the decline of diverse crops. Today, the threat is more urgent than ever.</p>

      <h3>Where?</h3>
      <p>The endangerment of crop species is a global problem, but it is especially severe in regions rich in traditional agricultural diversity, such as South Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Many of these areas historically contained thousands of local crop varieties that have now been replaced by a few standardized types. Even developed regions face losses as wild crop relatives disappear due to habitat destruction.</p>

      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>Crop species are becoming endangered due to factors such as monoculture farming, climate change, habitat loss, industrial seed systems, and the overuse of agricultural chemicals. As large commercial varieties dominate global markets, traditional crops receive less attention and protection. The erosion of indigenous knowledge and seed-saving practices also contributes to this decline, leaving crops more vulnerable.</p>

      <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>The loss of crop species harms the world by reducing food security, limiting nutritional diversity, and increasing vulnerability to pests, diseases, and climate stress. With fewer genetic options, crops are less adaptable to changing environmental conditions, raising the risk of widespread crop failures. This decline also results in cultural and economic losses, affecting both local traditions and global agriculture.</p>
