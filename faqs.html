<h3>What is the purpose of this website?</h3>
    <p>
        This website aims to educate people about the growing threat to global crop species,
        explain why crop diversity is important, and highlight actions that individuals,
        farmers, and organizations can take to protect endangered crops.
    </p>

    <h3>Why are crop species becoming endangered?</h3>
    <p>
        Crop species are at risk mainly due to monoculture farming, climate change, habitat loss,
        industrial seed systems, and the decline of traditional farming practices.
        These factors reduce genetic diversity, making crops more vulnerable to pests,
        diseases, and extreme weather.
    </p>

    <h3>Why is crop diversity important for the future?</h3>
    <p>
        Crop diversity provides essential genetic traits such as drought tolerance,
        disease resistance, and adaptability to climate change.
        Without diverse crops, global food security becomes unstable,
        and communities lose important nutritional and cultural foods.
    </p>

    <h3>Who is affected by the loss of crop species?</h3>
    <p>
        Everyone is affected, including farmers, consumers, indigenous communities,
        and future generations. Reduced crop diversity can lead to higher food prices,
        fewer food choices, increased food shortages, and the loss of traditional crops.
    </p>

    <h3>How can individuals help protect endangered crops?</h3>
    <p>
        Individuals can support crop diversity by buying local and diverse produce,
        choosing heirloom varieties, supporting seed-saving organizations,
        and spreading awareness about endangered crop species.
        Even small actions can help preserve valuable plant genetics.
    </p>

    <h3>What organizations are working to save endangered crop species?</h3>
    <p>
        Organizations such as the Crop Trust, FAO, CGIAR, and national seed banks
        work globally to conserve crop diversity. They maintain seed vaults,
        conduct research, and collaborate with farmers to protect endangered crops.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I access educational resources or reports on this topic?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes. This website provides access to research articles, videos, reports,
        and educational tools from trusted organizations such as FAO, UNEP,
        and National Geographic.
    </p>

    <h3>What is a seed bank, and why is it important?</h3>
    <p>
        A seed bank is a secure facility that stores seeds from thousands of plant species.
        Seed banks protect crop diversity by preserving seeds long-term so they can be
        replanted if species disappear from farms or natural environments.
    </p>

    <h3>How serious is the endangerment of crop species today?</h3>
    <p>
        The situation is very serious. Scientists estimate that up to 75% of crop diversity
        has already been lost in the last century. As climate change increases,
        many remaining wild and traditional crop varieties face extinction
        without active conservation efforts.
